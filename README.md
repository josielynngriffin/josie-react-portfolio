# React Portfolio

## Description
This is a portfolio of my current work, built with React.js from components! I tried to keep it accessible, easy to read, and with a format that anyone could understand and navigate. I plan to build on it as I go and make improvements, as well as implement a dark and light theme (as seen with the selector icon in the navigation that does not currently function!).

## Languages and Technologies
CSS, React.js, JavaScript, JSX
